# first-game

I followed this written tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/06.heads_up_display.html

I changed some of the HUD, removed some of the text from the tutorial and added an hp counter in the top right

I also added invicibility frames and changed the character to red during those frames. Including a sound effect on hit.
I changed the music to First of the Year by skrillex. It was just a joke while I had my roommate playing it, but I thought it was funny and made me motivated to get to a certain part of the song. so I feel that it added a lot to the game.

I only committed one time, so there won't be commits for every single feature I added, and on top of that I added my features as I was going through the tutorials

I used ChatGPT to help me add some of my features, however I did not just copy straight code, I had it walk me through the steps and if I got snagged on something it would help me fix certain errors. 

The main gain probably took me around 3 hours, then adding the hp functionality took me about an hour, maybe another 15-20 minutes for the hp on the hud. the on hit sound was really quick maybe 5 minutes, and the background music was like a 2 second change. Tt took me longer to download it than implement the change. Getting the timer to feel good on the invicibility after hit took me about 30-45 minutes, just because I was changing it as I was working on other stuff to get a feel for it. Overall it probably took me about 5 or 6 hours to complete my first game. I'm proud of it and didn't think itd be as much fun as it was.
